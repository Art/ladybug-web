Mike Bostock's Solar Calculator

## [Bostock Solar Calculator]( bostock-solar-calculator-r3.html )

* Partially re-written
* Has issues
	* Requires D3 for certain date calculations
	* Uses UTF-8 encoding - which is nice - but then embeds Greek characters - which is also cool 
		* But this makes it all even more remote and abstract for the layperson
* Considerably simpler than NOAA code
	* Mi=ust have some good insight as to where Ladybug Web Solar Calculator could simplify
