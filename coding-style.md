Ladybug Web Coding Style
===


Cookbook examples - small easy-to-understand scripts that you can use to hack your own apps

For STEM peeps - not 'full-stack programmers'

All written in JavaScript - even the CSS and HTML - Experimental techniques designed to get you coding faster but documented

Built to fork edit and share - all FOSS in GitHub

Explore new ways of visualizing in 3D - use the graphics processing units (GPUs ) to their maximum


<!--
Everything is in between two `<script>` tags and written JavaScript

Even the HTML and CSS is created and edited using JavaScript.

Everything you need to know about a script is in one place and written in the same way.

What does mean?

There are no black boxes - with things in other places - that you never look at.

Instead of a huge file of opaque CSS rules that are mostly never invoked, there's half a dozen rules just for the script in play
