Everything is in between two <script> tags and written JavaScript

Even the HTML and CSS is created and edited using JavaScript.

Everything you need to know about a script is in one place and written in the same way.

What does mean?

There are no black boxes - with things in other places - that you never look at.

Instead of a huge file of opaque CSS rules that are mostly never invoked, there;s half a dozen rules just for the script in play
