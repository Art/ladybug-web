There are currently twelve separate Scripts in this repo. The current practice seems to be that they are updated and looked at in order. The process starts with a solar calculator apps, then progresses to the Ana Lamas, then the Shadows, than the sun range scripts.

During this 'pilgrimage', if a useful new feature is added then it is added to all subsequent scripts in the progression. It may take a while before a new feature is added back to the beginning of the list. In other words new features are not added to all scripts at the same time.
